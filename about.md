The Erlang/OTP team at Ericsson are the implementors and maintainers of Erlang/OTP. Erlang/OTP
was released as Open Source 1998 and we have been around since then.

The intention with this blog is that we write posts about Erlang/OTP that is of general interest. It can be technical
posts about new or old features that we want to push for. It can also be historical flashbacks or anything else we think is interesting to share.

The posts will have different authors from the Erlang/OTP team.
