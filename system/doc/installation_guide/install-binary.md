# Installing the Binary Release

## Windows

The system is delivered as a Windows Installer executable. Get it from [https://erlang.org/downloads](https://erlang.org/downloads).

### Installing

The installation procedure is automated. Double-click the `.exe` file icon and follow the instructions.

### Verifying

* Start Erlang/OTP by double-clicking on the Erlang shortcut icon on the desktop.

  Expect a command-line window to pop up with an output looking something like this:

  ```text
    Erlang/OTP 17 [erts-6.0] [64-bit] [smp:2:2]
  
    Eshell V6.0  (abort with ^G)
    1>
  ```
* Exit by entering the command `halt()`.

  ```text
    2> halt().
  ```

  This closes the Erlang/OTP shell.
