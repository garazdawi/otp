# Introduction

## Scope

The SASL application provides support for:

* Error logging
* Alarm handling
* Release handling
* Report browsing

Section [SASL Error Logging](error_logging.md) describes the error handler that produces the supervisor, progress, and crash reports, which can be written to screen or to a specified file. It also describes the Report Browser (RB).

The sections about release structure and release handling have been moved to section [OTP Design Principles](`p:system:index.html`) in *System Documentation*.

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the Erlang programming language.
