Release upgrade file

## Description

The *release upgrade file* describes how a release is upgraded in a running system.

This file is automatically generated by [`systools:make_relup/3,4`](`systools:make_relup/3`), using a release resource file (`.rel`), application resource files (`.app`), and application upgrade files (`.appup`) as input.

## File Syntax

In a target system, the release upgrade file is to be located in directory `$ROOT/releases/Vsn`.

The `relup` file contains one single Erlang term, which defines the instructions used to upgrade the release. The file has the following syntax:

```text
{Vsn,
  [{UpFromVsn, Descr, Instructions}, ...],
  [{DownToVsn, Descr, Instructions}, ...]}.
```

* __`Vsn = string()`__ - Current release version.

* __`UpFromVsn = string()`__ - Earlier version of the release to upgrade from.

* __`Descr = term()`__ - A user-defined parameter passed from the function [`systools:make_relup/3,4`](`systools:make_relup/3`). It is used in the return value of [`release_handler:install_release/1,2`](`release_handler:install_release/1`).

* __`Instructions`__ - A list of low-level release upgrade instructions, see [`appup(4)`](appup.md). It consists of the release upgrade instructions from the respective application upgrade files (high-level instructions are translated to low-level instructions), in the same order as in the start script.

* __`DownToVsn = string()`__ - Earlier version of the release to downgrade to.
